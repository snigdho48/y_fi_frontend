## Bangladesh — additional notices

### Applicable law

If you use the App **in or from Bangladesh**, our processing of your personal data is subject to **applicable laws and regulations in Bangladesh**, including personal data protection rules in force from time to time (such as instruments adopted under the Digital Security Act framework and **personal data protection ordinances** and related amendments as enacted or updated). This policy is intended to help us meet transparency obligations; it is **not legal advice**. Adcelerate may adjust practices as Bangladesh’s regulatory guidance evolves.

### Your rights (Bangladesh)

Subject to applicable law and verification, users in Bangladesh may have rights that include:

- **Access** to your personal data we hold  
- **Correction** of inaccurate or incomplete data  
- **Deletion** or erasure where applicable  
- **Restriction** of certain processing  
- **Objection** to processing where the law allows  
- Information about **automated decision-making**, where relevant  

To exercise these rights, email us at **contact@adcelerate.com**. We will respond within a reasonable time as required by applicable law. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests.

### Children and minors (Bangladesh)

The App is **not directed at young children**. Where Bangladesh law requires **parental or guardian consent** for processing personal data relating to minors, we rely on appropriate consent mechanisms. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data without consent, contact us at **contact@adcelerate.com**.

### Cross-border transfers

Some of our processors (for example **Google / Firebase**, **Google Ads**, and hosting outside Bangladesh) may process data **outside Bangladesh**. Where the law requires safeguards for transfers, we use appropriate measures offered by those providers and contractual arrangements where applicable. See **International transfers** below.

### Complaints

If you are in Bangladesh and have a concern about how we handle personal data, contact us first at **contact@adcelerate.com**. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with **competent authorities or mechanisms designated under Bangladesh law** as those frameworks become operational.

## 1. Information we collect

### 1.1 You provide or we obtain through sign-in

- **Google sign-in (optional):** If you choose to sign in with Google, we receive information processed by Google and Firebase Authentication, including your Google account email, display name, and a Firebase user identifier used with our backend. That data is sent to our servers at **`https://app.freeyfi.com/api/`** when you complete login (for example to **`auth/login/`**) so we can create or recognize your account and issue an access token stored on your device.
- **Phone sign-in (if enabled in your build):** Firebase may process your phone number for verification. Profile fields available after sign-in may be stored locally as described below.

### 1.2 Device and connection information

The App collects and uses:

- **Device identifiers:** For example, on Android a device identifier exposed via the device info API, and on iOS the vendor identifier where available.
- **Device attributes:** Device manufacturer/model, operating system name and version.
- **Public IP address:** Obtained via a third-party IP lookup service (`dart_ipify` / Ipify) when the App requests device information — used in connection with Wi‑Fi session features.
- **Network state:** Information about connectivity so the App can tell when the device is online for features such as QR-based venue setup.

This information may be stored locally (see section 2) and sent to our servers when you use certain features, for example to **`data/collect/`** (including partner/venue identifiers tied to your session) for operational and session-related purposes.

### 1.3 Wi‑Fi and venue / hotspot usage

- **QR codes:** The App uses the camera to scan QR codes that identify a venue or hotspot. Parsed codes are sent to our backend (**`venue/data/`**) with your authorization token so the App can retrieve Wi‑Fi network details for that venue.
- **Wi‑Fi credentials:** SSID and password may be stored **locally on your device** to reconnect or manage timed sessions. Our systems may receive venue/partner identifiers and session-related data as described above, retained as required for our services and applicable law.

### 1.4 Permissions (why we ask)

Depending on platform and version, the App may request:

| Permission / capability | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| Internet | Connect to our API, ads, Firebase, and IP lookup. |
| Location (fine/coarse/background where declared) | Required by the OS for Wi‑Fi scanning and connection on many Android versions; may be used for Wi‑Fi-related features. |
| Camera | Scan QR codes for venue Wi‑Fi setup. |
| Nearby Wi‑Fi devices | Wi‑Fi configuration on supported Android versions. |
| Notifications | Show local notifications (e.g. connection status). |
| Foreground service / background work | Timers, reconnection, or background tasks as implemented. |
| **Advertising ID (Android)** | Declared for use with Google advertising services where applicable. |

iOS and Android may show their own permission dialogs; you can control many of these in system settings.

### 1.5 Advertising and analytics (third parties)

- **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):** The App initializes the Google Mobile Ads SDK and may display ads. Google may use the **advertising ID** (on supported Android versions) and other data as described in Google’s policies. See: [Google’s Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and (for ads) [How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
- **Ad delivery metadata:** The App may request ad configuration from our backend (**`ad/load/`**), including device-related identifiers already collected by the App (such as device id) and optional partner/venue identifiers — so ads can be contextual to the session.

### 1.6 Firebase / Google services

We use **Firebase** (including Authentication and core initialization). Google processes data according to its terms. See: [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and Firebase documentation.

### 1.7 In-app updates (Android)

On Android, the App may check for updates via Google Play’s in-app update APIs and, when required by our implementation, open the Play Store listing or prompt for an update. Google processes information related to installs and updates under Google’s policies.

### 1.8 Web content in the App

Advertisement or partner content may be shown inside an **in-app WebView**. That content may set cookies or collect information according to the third party’s own policies. We do not control those third-party sites.

---

## 2. Local storage on your device

The App uses on-device storage for items such as:

- Authentication **tokens**, **email**, **display name**, **group name**, and related session fields  
- **Wi‑Fi SSID and password** for reconnect flows  
- **Venue/partner identifiers**, connection timestamps, and flags used for session timing  
- **Device id / device profile fields** used for ads and API calls  

Data remains on your device unless transmitted to our servers or third-party services as described above. **Signing out** in the App removes several stored fields locally and signs out of Firebase; you should still treat lost devices as a security risk.

---

## 3. How we use information

We use the information above to:

- Provide login, Wi‑Fi venue connection, timed sessions, and notifications  
- Operate and secure our services and backend API  
- Show advertisements and request ad configuration  
- Improve reliability and troubleshoot issues  

---

## 4. Sharing of information

We may share information with:

- **Service providers** that process data on our behalf (e.g. cloud hosting, Firebase/Google, advertising networks), subject to their terms  
- **Legal or safety reasons** when required by law or to protect rights and safety  

We do not sell your personal information as a standalone commercial product; where regional laws define “sale” broadly (e.g. certain U.S. state laws), review our disclosures in Google Play’s **Data safety** section and applicable regional notices.

---

## 5. Security

We use reasonable measures to protect information in transit and on our systems. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

---

## 6. Children’s privacy (general)

In addition to the **Bangladesh** subsection above: if you believe we have collected data from a child inappropriately, email **contact@adcelerate.com** and we will take appropriate steps.

---

## 7. Your rights and choices

**Bangladesh users:** see **Your rights (Bangladesh)** in the Bangladesh section at the top.

You may also:

- Revoke permissions in device settings  
- Use Google’s [My Ad Center](https://myadcenter.google.com/) and device settings to limit ad personalization where available  
- Uninstall the App  

---

## 8. International transfers

Information may be transferred to and processed in countries **outside Bangladesh** (including where Google and other processors operate). Those countries may have different data protection laws. We rely on provider safeguards (such as contractual terms offered by Google) where applicable. **Bangladesh users:** see **Cross-border transfers** above.
